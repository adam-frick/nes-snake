Snake game in 6502 NES Assembly. Only tested in Mednafen.

**todo:**
* optimise snake branches (genericise them with passed vars defining flow)
* detect collision (potentially expensive!), slowly decrement length afterwards
* taper snake tile to easier discern snake movement
* check if collision is with head before fruit hit
* revise fruit spawning to be within screen
