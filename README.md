Snake game in 6502 NES Assembly. Only tested in Mednafen.

**todo:**
* optimise snake branches (genericise them with passed vars defining flow)
* revise fruit spawning to be within screen
* prevent moving in opposite direction of movement (check snake_dir)
* reimplement snake death
* force concurrent sprite and tile updating
