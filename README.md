Snake game in 6502 NES Assembly. Only tested in Mednafen.

**todo:**
*optimise snake branches (genericise them with passed vars defining flow)
*add snake fruit, modify growth branch to occur upon collision
*detect collision (potentially expensive!), slowly decrement length afterwards
*taper snake tile to easier discern snake movement
